miepython
=========

`miepython` is a pure Python module to calculate light scattering by
non-absorbing, partially-absorbing, or perfectly conducting spheres. Mie
theory is used, following the procedure described by Wiscombe
<http://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/technotes:232>. This code has
been validated against his results. The code is at 
<https://github.com/scottprahl/miepython>

This code provides functions for calculating the extinction efficiency,
scattering efficiency, backscattering, and scattering asymmetry.
Moreover, a set of angles can be given to calculate the scattering at various
angles for a sphere.

Heads up!
---------
When comparing different Mie scattering codes, make sure that you're
aware of the conventions used by each code.  `miepython` makes the
following assumptions

* the imaginary part of the complex index of refraction for absorbing spheres is *negative*.  

* the scattering phase function is normalized so it equals the *single scattering albedo* when integrated over 4Ï€ steradians.
